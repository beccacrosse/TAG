# Inspiration
The inspiration for "Tag" came from a desire to bridge the gap between people, across all ages and interests, in a deeply personal yet digital way. Recognizing the limitations of existing social platforms in fostering genuine connections that have become less social and more media-centric, especially during times when physical distances have grown, "Tag" seeks to reintroduce the intimacy and authenticity often missing from our online interactions.

# What it does
"Tag" is a mobile application that facilitates meaningful conversations through thoughtfully crafted prompts. It prompts different groups of people daily, allowing a centralized platform for connections to thrive, gaining knowledge and adaptively responding to user behavior. It encourages users to share more than just superficial updates, diving into reflective and personal exchanges. This platform stands out by focusing on depth and the loneliness epidemic, allowing friends and connections to engage on a level that strengthens their relationships, regardless of the physical distance.

# How we built it
The app was developed using React Native/typescript and node, enabling a cross-platform presence from the get-go. Figma was a big help. Key challenges included integrating storage for real-time data handling and pivoting from Convex to an API with async storage due to server demand issues. Despite the steep learning curve with technologies and collaborative tools like Git, the team's dedication and adaptability were paramount in bringing "Tag" to life.

# Challenges we ran into
The journey of incorporating backend services was fraught with technical hurdles. Initially opting for Convex presented a steep learning curve and unforeseen server demand issues, leading to a critical pivot towards Firebase and async storage solutions. This shift demanded rapid adaptation and a reevaluation of our backend strategy under tight deadlines. Concurrently, mastering Git for effective team collaboration introduced its own set of challenges, compounded by the unexpected illness of a team member, which threatened to reduce our workforce. These obstacles tested our resolve, adaptability, and teamwork skills in the face of uncertainty.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully completing our first hackathon as an all-women team, we're proud of sticking closely to our design specifications and prioritizing user-centric design. The development of "Tag" demonstrated our ability to work harmoniously, overcome technical and personal challenges, and create a product that resonates with our intended audience. The thoughtful design, including handwritten fonts and engaging prompts, reflects our commitment to creating meaningful digital spaces.

# What we learned
This journey taught us invaluable lessons in app development, teamwork, and design consistency. We learned the importance of early starts, in-depth communication before diving into tasks, and the need to always pull before pushing in Git. The experience has been enlightening, providing us with a solid foundation in both technical and collaborative skills.

# What's next for Tag
Encouraged by positive feedback and the potential impact on fostering connections (we asked our friends and long-distance friends for feedback :)), we're excited to further develop "Tag." Plans include expanding its features, refining the user experience based on real-world testing, and potentially exploring avenues for wider adoption. We would love to build it out to include more back-end, user authentication, mass database storage and more. Our vision for "Tag" goes beyond a project; it's about creating a platform that treats the loneliness academics, enriches friendships and bridges distances with heartfelt conversations.
